Welcome to my new static website generated with Jekyll! Finally I got fed
up with my single-page website so I was looking for a nice way to setup
my new website.

In spired by my former co-worker Marijn from [Serra ICT](http://www.serraict.com/), I took a look at Jekyll. Soon I found a Bootstrap 3 template for Jekyll [here](https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-io.github.io), which seem to fit my needs perfectly! Just like Marijn, I host my site at github using github-pages. It works as a charm!

A nice blog posting of Kyle Banks showed how to add some category listings to my website: 
<https://kylewbanks.com/blog/creating-category-pages-in-jekyll-without-plugins>

Maybe you would like to take a look at the [sources](https://github.com/jkeuper/jkeuper.github.io) of my website? Or you might want to try out a static generated website with _free_ [webhosting](https://pages.github.com/)?

Thanks Marijn, I owe you a beer!
