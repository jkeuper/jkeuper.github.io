On my road to OSCP I just finished one awesome week of OSCP Training.
The live Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PWK) training by Offensive Security
trainers. 

## Penetration Testing with Kali Linux
The whole [training program](https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/penetration-testing-with-kali.pdf)
was a thrill. I've done the online PWK by myself, two years ago, but doing this live
with a group of 15 people with guidance of three trainers from Offensive Security,
was really awesome! 

## Wrap up
Great to have finally met [some](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/) guys from Offensive Security.
Some tricks you just won't discover by yourself.

And now? Busting my ass off in the labs for 60 days, prepping for the exam. Improving
notes and learning! And above all, TRY HARDER!
