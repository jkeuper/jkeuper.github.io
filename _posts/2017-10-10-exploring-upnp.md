To me Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) alway was a mysterious protocol. When
some cool program required an open port, UPnP made it happen. When some
fancy program did not work, someone would ask me: "Did you enable UPnP"?
Right, I forgot... I had no clue what magic UPnP did for me.

The problem UPnP solves, in this case, is simple. Almost every home network
uses Network Address Translation (NAT), so your internal devices cannot
be reached unless you map a port on the external IP interface, to a port
of a computer on your internal network.

Quote from wikipedia:
> Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of networking protocols that permits networked devices [...] to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and establish functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment.

Now that's pretty awesome! (For the security minded people: "Uh oh, Houston
we have a problem...") Ofcourse it's nice that you can find your printer
_automatically_ and your media player shows your media storage device to
pick your movies from.

## The experiment
UPnP had its share of flaws. Unintended errors in UPnP software that were
exploitable, but for now let's focus on the really awesome features of
UPnP. Let's pick our initial case and see how we can use UPnP to make
one or more internal unreachable ports, reachable for the world.

The UPnP stack consists of 6 layers:

| Layer        | Description                         
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- 
| Discovery    | finding UPnP devices on the network 
| Description  | Find what services the devices is offering 
| Control      | Ask for an action of that device 
| Eventing     | Subscribe to state changes 
| Presentation | The human controllable interface  
| Adressing    | Of no DHCP is available, the device uses it's on IP-range.

In this post we will only cover the first three layers: Discovery, Description and Control, because we only need to open up a port.

## Discovery
Let's discover some devices! UPnP uses HTTP over UDP (HTTPU) and broadcasts
UPD packets on port 1900. The discovery protocol is known as Simple Service
Discovery Protocol ([SSDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol)).

From the top, we'll do a M-SEARCH request to the broadcast address
192.168.1.255 on port 1900. We are querying for devices with the
InternetGatewayDevice profile:

```python
import socket

# Construct the message
msg = \
    'M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1\r\n' \
    'HOST:192.168.1.255:1900\r\n' \
    'ST:urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice:1\r\n' \
    'MX:2\r\n' \
    'MAN:"ssdp:discover"\r\n'

# Set up UDP socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM, socket.IPPROTO_UDP)
s.settimeout(2)
s.sendto(msg, ('192.168.1.255', 1900) )

# Listen for data until timeout
try:
    while True:
        data, addr = s.recvfrom(8192)
        print addr, data
except socket.timeout:
    pass
```

## Discovery Response
Running the script gives the response below. What we are interested in is
the "LOCATION" value:

```console
('192.168.1.1', 1900) HTTP/1.1 200 OK
CACHE-CONTROL: max-age=120
ST: urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice:1
USN: uuid:A37351C5-8521-4c24-A43E-AC22055E489C::urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice:1
EXT:
SERVER: Compal Broadband Networks, Inc/Linux/2.6.39.3 UPnP/1.1 MiniUPnPd/1.7
LOCATION: http://192.168.1.1:5000/rootDesc.xml
OPT: "http://schemas.upnp.org/upnp/1/0/"; ns=01
01-NLS: 1
BOOTID.UPNP.ORG: 1
CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG: 1337
```

## Query description
The desciption xml is a bit long. We'll show the most important part below. From the service information,
we are looking for the controlUrl:

```xml
  ...
  <service>
    <serviceType>urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1</serviceType>
    <serviceId>urn:upnp-org:serviceId:WANIPConn1</serviceId>
    <controlURL>/ctl/IPConn</controlURL>
    <eventSubURL>/evt/IPConn</eventSubURL>
    <SCPDURL>/WANIPCn.xml</SCPDURL>
  </service>
  ...
```

## Control device
We have the address, the port and the path of the control URL. Now let's craft a soap message to open external port 8888 and map it to port 8888 on our internal ip 192.269.1.165.

```python
import urllib2
soap_body = """<?xml version="1.0"?>
<s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
            s:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
  <s:Body>
    <u:AddPortMapping xmlns:u="urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1">
      <NewExternalPort>8888</NewExternalPort>
      <NewProtocol>TCP</NewProtocol>
      <NewInternalPort>8888</NewInternalPort>
      <NewInternalClient>192.168.1.165</NewInternalClient>
      <NewEnabled>1</NewEnabled>
      <NewPortMappingDescription>Added port via upnp</NewPortMappingDescription>
      <NewLeaseDuration>0</NewLeaseDuration>
    </u:AddPortMapping>
  </s:Body>
</s:Envelope>"""

headers = {
    'SOAPAction': 'urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1#AddPortMapping',
    'Host': '192.168.1.1:5000/',
    'Content-Type': 'text/xml',
    'Content-Length': len(soap_body),
}

ctrl_url = "http://192.168.1.1:5000/ctl/IPConn"

request = urllib2.Request(ctrl_url, soap_body, headers)
response = urllib2.urlopen(request)

print response.read()
```

Now, send this message and show the response:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
            s:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
  <s:Body>
     <u:AddPortMappingResponse xmlns:u="urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1"/>
  </s:Body>
</s:Envelope>
```

Wheeee, success! As result we can see a new forwarding rule is added in
my router. Port 8888 on my external IP address is forwareded to port 8888
on my internal address 192.168.1.165.

## Wrap up
With UPnP an attacker has a golden opportunity to gain access to your network.
Vulnerable services could expose them self to the world or attackers might
be able to open a port on your router. You better disable UPnP on your router.

Of course there are easier ways to forward a port using UPnP. A nice tool is [MiniUPnPc](http://miniupnp.free.fr/) which allows you to execute UPnP commands from the command line.

Forwarding a port 8888 of the current machine can be done by executing
the following command.
```console
$ upnpc -e 'Added port via upnp' -r 8888 TCP
```

To list all port redirections.
```console
$ upnpc -l

Much easier than scripting it all yourself, but now you have learned how UPnP work!

PS: Some routers don't allow manual port forwards for ports below 1024 or for reserved
port numbers, but allow forwards done with UPnP!!!
